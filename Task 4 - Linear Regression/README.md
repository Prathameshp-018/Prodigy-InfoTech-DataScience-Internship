# 🚗 Task 4 - Linear Regression
**Internship:** Prodigy InfoTech – Data Science Internship  
**Intern:** Prathamesh Patil  

---

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this task is to **build and evaluate a Linear Regression model** that predicts the price of cars based on their engine size, horsepower, weight, and mileage.  
This helps understand how different car features influence the overall market price.

## 🧠 Steps Performed
1. **Imported** required Python libraries (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn).  
2. **Loaded & explored** the Car Price dataset.  
3. **Cleaned data** by checking for duplicates and missing values.  
4. **Selected key numeric features**: `enginesize`, `horsepower`, `curbweight`, `highwaympg`.  
5. **Split** data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.  
6. **Trained** a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn.  
7. **Evaluated** the model using R², MAE, MSE, and RMSE metrics.  
8. **Visualized** Actual vs Predicted prices and residual distribution.  
9. **Interpreted** model coefficients to understand feature importance.

## 📊 Key Results
| Metric | Value |
|---------|--------|
| **R² Score** | (Replace with your result, e.g., 0.87) |
| **MAE** | (e.g., 1200.56) |
| **RMSE** | (e.g., 1800.42) |

## 🔍 Insights
- Engine size, horsepower, and curb weight are the strongest predictors of car price.  
- The model explains most of the variation in price (high R²).  
- Model errors are fairly normally distributed, meaning predictions are balanced.  
- Categorical variables (like fuel type or car body) can be added later to improve accuracy.

## 🧩 Libraries Used
- **pandas**
- **numpy**
- **matplotlib**
- **seaborn**
- **scikit-learn**

## 🏁 Conclusion
The Linear Regression model successfully predicts car prices with good accuracy and provides clear insights into how engine and performance factors affect pricing.
