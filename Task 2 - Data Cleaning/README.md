🧹 Task 2 - Data Cleaning

As part of my Data Science Internship at Prodigy InfoTech, this task focused on cleaning and preprocessing raw data to make it suitable for analysis and visualization.

🧾 Objective

To identify and handle missing, duplicate, and inconsistent data within the dataset, and prepare a cleaned version ready for analysis.

⚙️ Steps Performed

Importing Libraries – Used pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn for data processing and visualization.

Loading Dataset – Imported the Students Performance in Exams dataset.

Exploratory Checks – Used .info(), .describe(), and .head() to understand data structure and types.

Handling Missing Values – Checked and filled or removed missing data using fillna() and other techniques.

Removing Duplicates – Verified with .duplicated() and removed duplicate records.

Fixing Inconsistencies – Standardized column names and string formats.

Outlier Detection – Created a boxplot to visually inspect outliers in numerical columns.

Exporting Cleaned Data – Saved the cleaned dataset as StudentsPerformance_Cleaned.csv.
