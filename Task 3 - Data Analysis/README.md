# 🚗 Task 3 - Data Analysis

This task was completed as part of my **Data Science Internship at Prodigy InfoTech**.

## 🎯 Objective
Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to discover patterns, correlations, and insights in the **Car Price Prediction Dataset**.

---

## 🧰 Steps Performed

1. **Data Importing** – Loaded dataset using Pandas.  
2. **Data Exploration** – Checked structure, summary statistics, and missing values.  
3. **Univariate Analysis** – Studied individual features like price, fuel type, and horsepower.  
4. **Bivariate Analysis** – Examined relationships between car attributes and price.  
5. **Correlation Analysis** – Built a heatmap to find relationships among numerical features.  
6. **Insight Generation** – Summarized key findings and trends in the data.

## 📁 Files Included
- `Task3_Data_Analysis.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook  
- `CarPrice_Assignment.csv` → Dataset used for analysis  

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Engine size, horsepower, and curb weight have a strong positive correlation with price.  
- Cars with turbo engines are generally priced higher.  
- Fuel type (diesel vs. gas) and body style also affect price trends.  

---

## 🚀 Outcome
Through EDA, I identified major features that impact car prices and understood how visual and statistical analysis can uncover patterns in business data.
